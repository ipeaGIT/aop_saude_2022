The R scripts to reproduce the results are divided into four stages:

-   `1.0_prepare_data.R`
    - Downloads the accessibility data using the [aopdata](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/aopdata) R package
    - Downloads the Mapbox tiles for generating map plots
-   `2.0_Fig3.R`
    - Generates Figure 3
    - Figure is saved in `Figures/`
-   `2.1_Fig1_2_4.R`
    - Generates Figures 1, 2 and 4.
-   `style.R` and `colours.R`
    - Auxiliary scripts used in `2.1_Fig1_2_4.R` to adjust the style and colours of the Figures.
